This project is a work in progress. While the code is available, it is not fully developed or properly annotated yet, so proceed at your own risk! These analyses are meant to be a beginner-friendly introduction to working with remote sensing data (satellite imagery and LiDAR) and open source data portals, and may be used as training material in the future.

I found the inspiration for this project when apartment hunting in downtown Toronto. I was deciding between places in two nearby neighborhoods, and neighborhood greenspace was an important factor to consider. In this project, I compare greenspace and urban forest cover between two neighborhoods. I make some simplified calculations estimating green space using NDVI from remote sensing data, and I estimate summer tree/leaf cover area using the tree point data from the open data portal from the city of Toronto.
