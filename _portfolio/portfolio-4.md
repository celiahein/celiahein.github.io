This is a short but thorough tutorial for extracting and calculating landscape variables across multiple spatiotemporal scales using the `landscapemetrics` package in R.

If you want to work through this project on your own, you can check it out on my [Github](https://github.com/celiahein/Extracting_data_multiple_spatiotemporal_scales) or read through it [here](/files/Extracting_data_multiple_scales.html).
